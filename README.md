# Twitter fake news and user analysis with NetworkX graphs
This is a Networks course final project for my university USFQ. The goal of this assignment is to be able to extract relevant features from networks of users in Twitter and plot them in a graph, with a focus on users who engage in communicating fake news.


The project consists of two python scripts:
* `tweets_to_csv.py` downloads tweets from the Twitter API and stores them as `.csv` files.
* `analysis.py` plots pie charts and graphs about the found data, with some analysis focusing on a specific tweet.

The detailed project report is in Jupyter Notebooks format `An√°lisis de tweets, fake news, y redes de usuarios en Twitter.ipynb`.

`twitter.ipynb` contains the code from `tweets_to_csv.py` with additional explanations.

Further expantion of this project will include fake news detection on tweets using machine learning techniques.
