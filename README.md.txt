# Twitter fake news and user analysis with NetworkX graphs
The project consists of two python scripts:
* `tweets_to_csv.py` downloads tweets from the Twitter API and stores them as `.csv` files.
* `analysis.py` plots pie charts and graphs about the found data, with some analysis focusing on a specific tweet.

The detailed project report is in Jupyter Notebooks format `An√°lisis de tweets, fake news, y redes de usuarios en Twitter.ipynb`.

`twitter.ipynb` contains the code from `tweets_to_csv.py` with additional explanations.
